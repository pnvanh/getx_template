# GetX Template

This is a teamplate for [GetX package](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for State management, State Manager routing and Dependency Injection (bindings) for Flutter.
I'm using MVVM (Model View ViewModel) architectural pattern here. For network call we are using [Dio package](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)  and followed the recommended folder structure of GetX.
## Architecture: MVVM
